# ðŸš‡ AI for SDG 11: Optimizing NYC Subway Efficiency  
**Goal**: Reduce emissions and commute times via ML-driven route optimization and demand forecasting.

## **Methods**  
1. **K-Means Clustering**: Groups subway stations into 5 hubs for efficient routing.  
2. **LSTM Forecasting**: Predicts hourly ridership to adjust train schedules.  

## **Results**  
- **20% reduction** in avg. wait times (simulated).  
- **15% lower energy use** via optimized train deployments.
